          "summary": "<p>Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou has called for an end to the questioning of officials’ decisions in order to prevent their authority being undermined.</p><p>Spurs had two players sent off in the 4-1 defeat – their first loss of the Premier League season – at home to Chelsea but refused to criticise referee Michael Oliver.</p><p>However, after a first half which had 12 minutes added on due to several VAR checks, the Australian felt a number of incidents have led to an overuse of technology.</p><p>Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta called Newcastle’s winning goal against his team after three VAR checks a “disgrace” on Saturday and the club issued a statement calling for the standard of officiating to be “urgently addressed”.</p><p>“Decisions are decisions: you either accept it or you don’t,” Postecoglou told Sky Sports.</p><p>“Some of it is self-inflicted (but) if we are going to go out and complain about bad decisions every week what will happen is what happened today: a forensic study of every decision.</p><p>“I think that’s the way the game is going. I don’t like it – I could be a lone voice as I’m told that’s the way forward. With VAR intervention it just felt like a lot of standing around.</p><p>“At some point we have to accept the referee’s decision. This constant erosion of referees’ authority, this is what the game is going to get: they will not have any authority, it is going to get diminished and we are going to be in the control of someone a few miles away watching a TV screen.”</p><p>Spurs had led through Dejan Kulusevski’s sixth-minute deflected goal and had a second from Son Heung-min ruled out for offside by VAR.</p><p>But when Cristian Romero was sent off for a challenge on Enzo Fernandez which allowed Cole Palmer to equaliser from the penalty spot the game changed and a reckless second yellow card for Destiny Udogie early in the second half left the hosts with an uphill battle.</p><p>They held out until the 75th minute when Nicolas Jackson scored the first goal of his hat-trick, adding two more deep into added time.</p><p>“It’s pretty hard to process because it’s almost impossible to analyse the game,” added Postecoglou.</p><p>“You’re left disappointed with the result but proud of the efforts of the players and that is the positive we will take out of it.”</p>",
